generations:
  - name: "First Generation (XE20)"
    start_year: 2006
    end_year: 2013
    description: "The first-generation Lexus IS 350 debuted as the performance-oriented model in the second-generation IS lineup. Powered by a 3.5-liter V6 engine (2GR-FSE) producing 306 horsepower and 277 lb-ft of torque, featuring both direct and port injection systemsâ€”an innovative dual injection system at the time. Initially available only with a six-speed automatic transmission with paddle shifters and exclusively in rear-wheel drive configuration, it could accelerate from 0-60 mph in approximately 5.3 seconds. The exterior featured sleek styling with a rising beltline and fastback-like profile, while the interior offered a driver-focused cockpit with high-quality materials and available luxury features including a Mark Levinson premium audio system, touchscreen navigation, and ventilated front seats. The double-wishbone front and multi-link rear suspension provided sporty handling characteristics, while the Vehicle Dynamics Integrated Management (VDIM) system integrated stability control, traction control, and ABS for enhanced safety. A minor refresh in 2009 brought subtle styling updates, followed by a more significant update in 2011 with the addition of Lexus's spindle grille design, LED daytime running lights, and interior improvements. Throughout its production, the first-generation IS 350 established itself as a credible performance sedan, though it maintained a more comfort-oriented character compared to some European rivals."

  - name: "Second Generation (XE30)"
    start_year: 2014
    end_year: 2020
    description: "The second-generation IS 350 featured more aggressive styling with Lexus's signature spindle grille design prominently displayed, more angular headlights, and sharper body lines. Mechanically, it continued with an updated version of the 3.5-liter V6 engine maintaining 306 horsepower and 277 lb-ft of torque. Rear-wheel drive models received an eight-speed automatic transmission, while all-wheel drive versions (added to the IS 350 range for this generation) used a six-speed automatic. The chassis was significantly stiffer than its predecessor, offering improved handling dynamics, particularly with the available adaptive variable suspension. The interior saw major improvements with higher quality materials, enhanced technology including a larger infotainment display with Remote Touch controller, and a more premium feel overall. The F Sport package, especially popular on the IS 350, added unique exterior styling elements, bolstered sport seats, a special sport-tuned suspension, and an available variable gear ratio steering system. A refresh in 2017 brought even more aggressive styling, standard Lexus Safety System+ driver assistance features, and an updated infotainment system with a 10.3-inch display on navigation-equipped models. Throughout this generation, the IS 350 served as the performance model in the standard IS lineup (positioned below the limited-production IS F), appealing to buyers seeking a balance of luxury and sporting capability."

  - name: "Third Generation (XE40)"
    start_year: 2021
    end_year: null
    description: "The third-generation IS 350 represents an evolution of the previous model rather than a complete redesign, built on a heavily revised version of the second-generation platform with significant improvements to structural rigidity, suspension components, and overall dynamics. The exterior styling is more aggressive than ever, with an enlarged spindle grille, slimmer headlights with revised LED daytime running light signatures, and a full-width taillight design. The 3.5-liter V6 continues with 311 horsepower and 280 lb-ft of torque (a slight increase from the previous generation), maintaining the eight-speed automatic for rear-wheel drive models and six-speed automatic for all-wheel drive variants. The suspension was thoroughly retuned with lighter components and revised geometry, benefiting from expertise gained through the development of the LC coupe and flagship LS sedan. The interior features updated technology with a standard 8-inch or available 10.3-inch touchscreen that's moved closer to the driver for easier operation, replacing the previous Remote Touch controller. Safety technology was enhanced with Lexus Safety System+ 2.5, including improved pre-collision system with pedestrian detection, emergency steering assist, and all-speed dynamic radar cruise control. The F Sport package is now available in multiple tiers, with the Dynamic Handling Package adding adaptive variable suspension, a Torsen limited-slip differential (RWD only), and unique 19-inch forged alloy wheels with performance tires. This generation of the IS 350 focuses on driving dynamics and emotional engagement while updating technology and safety features to contemporary standards, positioning it as a sport sedan for enthusiast drivers within the Lexus lineup."
